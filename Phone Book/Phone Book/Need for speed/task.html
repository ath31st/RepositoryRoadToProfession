<h5 style="text-align: center;">Description</h5>

<p>Let's use faster methods to sort the list of numbers and to search in the list.</p>

<p>As in the previous stage, you should first sort the list of phone numbers by the ownerâ€™s name and then search for the numbers of the 500 people from the list given in the first stage. Remember: to get decent and comparable results, you should put all the algorithms in the same initial conditions.</p>

<p>For sorting, use the quick sort algorithm, and for searching, use the binary search algorithm.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>

<p>Output all three approaches one after another and see which one is faster. The output example is shown below. Note that you can get totally different sorting and searching times!</p>

<pre><code class="java">Start searching (linear search)...
Found 500 / 500 entries. Time taken: 1 min. 56 sec. 328 ms.

Start searching (bubble sort + jump search)...
Found 500 / 500 entries. Time taken: 9 min. 15 sec. 291 ms.
Sorting time: 8 min. 45 sec. 251 ms.
Searching time: 0 min. 30 sec. 40 ms.

Start searching (quick sort + binary search)...
